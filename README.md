# Neovim Configuration

_Warning_: Use my configuration at your own risk!

- About this config

Neovim is a refactor, and sometimes redactor, in the tradition of Vim (which itself derives from [Stevie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_%28text_editor%29)). It is not a rewrite but a continuation and extension of Vim.

## Setup

Requires Neovim (>=0.5)

There are other methods for configuring neovim; however, this repository is totally setup and written in [lua](https://www.lua.org). If you wish to test out my configuration, you will need to make sure that neovim is installed first. Additionally, in the event that you find that my configuration is not to your liking, you should relocate your previous configuration before continuing.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/codewithjom/neovim-from-scratch ~/.config/nvim
```
